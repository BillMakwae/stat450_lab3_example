To determine whether there is a relationship between bill length and bill depth we will need to consider a linear regression model :



This utilizes the Ad√©lie penguin as the baseline. After fitting the model we would have to verify that the variance of residuals is the same and that relationship between length and depth is indeed a linear relationship. This can be achieved by plotting a graph of the errors and seeing if it is normally distributed.
